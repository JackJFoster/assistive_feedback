# ASSISTIVE FEEDBACK

## Objectives

Develop some Python that can:

+ Download submissions for a Canvas Assignment and convert them to plain text (DONE, RT).
+ Use ChatGPT to generate SPAG feedback and signposting to resources for students.

## Install requirements

Best to do this with pipenv:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Create a config.py file

Make a duplicate of the config-example.py and rename it config.py.

Update the variables in the file with the relevant URLS/TOKENS.
